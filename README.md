# CNN-Food-101-
This repository contains an in-depth code of how to deal with image classification problems. The dataset used here is the renowned food-101 dataset.

The following points have been considered while building a CNN model here - 
Data Augmentation
Regularization
Transfer learning

Apart from this, separate models have been built for both PyTorch and TensorFlow (light and a medium model each).

Use of tensorboard has also been implemented for ease of understanding of the important metrics.
